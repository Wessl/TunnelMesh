# TunnelMesh
Procedurally generating 3d geometry out of nothing

[Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzm680prY2I&)

### Explanation: 
This is a Unity game where the world consists of a procedurally generated, musically adaptive 3d tunnel. The geometry does not exist until it is generated by the game. It also places various (pre-made) assets along the path. You can fly along it and see how long you survive. The game also reacts to the music playing. For example, the light's flash varies in intensity in sync with the beat of the song. When the beat drops, a psychedelic experience begins where all of the geometry bounces to the beat, the textures start flowing inwards, and all the colors also start varying.
