todo:
music
procedurally placed lights that flash/lerp between brightness/colors based on bpm of music, could be placed in like a fun pattern along the ground. and parallel along players path maybe
how about instead of just the normal boring one-off short pipes, one single long pipe that stretches along the whole thing on the ground or somethng? think like that one portal scene with wires and pipes hanging everywhere
ok whaddabout this. one shader that procedurally generates sprites-ish that looks like background wall plates from the death star. like randy did for his uuh ground, but for walls. 
a small 3d critter running along the walls 
cool light streak behind you
