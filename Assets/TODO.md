* music
* ~procedurally placed lights that flash/lerp between brightness/colors based on bpm of music, could be placed in like a fun pattern along the ground. and parallel along players path maybe~
* how about instead of just the normal boring one-off short pipes, one single long pipe that stretches along the whole thing on the ground or somethng? think like that one portal scene with wires and pipes hanging everywhere
* ok whaddabout this. one shader that procedurally generates sprites-ish that looks like background wall plates from the death star. like randy did for his uuh ground, but for walls. 
* a small 3d critter running along the walls 
* cool light streak behind you, that only activates after beat drops. rainbow colored?
* close off beginning of tunnel so it feels like you start inside of it
* ~spedometer thats like an actual circle with an arrow~
* tone down the fog and film grain, it's a bit too much tbh
* ~restart button~

* ui that shows you where center of screen is?

* ~make it feel like you are going faster, screen shake? also incrased global voluime?~
* explodesion on death

* you can only play the game once?  or not idk
* upload highscores to web server?
